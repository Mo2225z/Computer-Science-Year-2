Grid Layout Design:

In order to add different sections to the CSS you can give each section a class then refer back to the grid template areas.
grid-template-areas: "nav" "uni" "academic"  "social" "transport" "modules" "lecture" "crime" "review" "rating" "write";
You can another section to this area.
grid-template-rows: repeat(9, auto);
This is the amount of rows on the page for the grid that will seperate them out. You can change the number to add new sections.
